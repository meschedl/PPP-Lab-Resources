### Broad Range dsDNA Qubit Protocol using the ***Biotium Reagents***
protocol adapted from original lab [Invitrogen Qubit protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols_and_Lab_Resources/DNA_Quality_Control/Invitrogen-Qubit-Assay-Protocol.md) and updated with the [Biotium AccuGreen Broad Range dsDNA Kit protocol](https://biotium.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PI-31069.pdf).

1. Take amber bottle of AccuGreenTM Broad Range dsDNA Quantitation Solution (refered to as "Quant Soln" from now on) and standards out of the 4 degree fridge and let get to room temp while you set up. You can place all kit components in a 37°C water bath for rapid warming; however be sure to allow solutions to cool to room temperature before using.
2. Set up thin walled Axygen tubes (in black boxes with yellow label): enough for each of your samples plus 2 more for standards. Label appropriately. They fit nicely in the black tubes racks on the underside
3. Once to room temp, gently invert Quant Soln bottle.
4. Add 190μl of Quant Soln to each sample and standard tube.
5. Vortex and spin down standards (if large bottles no need to spin down). Add 10µl of standard 1 to the standard 1 thin walled tube, add 10µl standard 2 to the thin walled standard 2 tube
6. *Vortex and spin down your samples before addition.* If you have RNA it MUST be kept on ice, DNA should as well. Add **1μl of sample** to its corresponding thin walled sample tube. *Be careful to add the 1μl directly to solution in the tube. Never rely on the quick pressure of depressing the plunger to get out all of 1μl, small volumes often have stronger attraction to stay inside the pipette tip than to go out into air, but if it has another liquid to go into, it will come out easier*
7. Incubate prepped standard and sample tubes for about 2 minutes at room temperature before running assay.
8. Vortex and spin down all tubes (the Qubit station has a vortexer and a minifuge with inserts for these tubes)
9. The Qubit is touch-screen. Choose appropriate assay in the Qubit and read standard tubes. DNA standards should have a 10 fold difference between S1 and S2. It is always best practice to record your standards values. These are read in RFU (florescence) units
10. If you have only a few samples, wait about a minute before reading. If you have a lot of samples, the time it takes to vortex and read samples should be enough. Read each sample tube one at a time. Our settings are 1μl of sample and we want the output to be ng/μl
11. Read your samples twice: go through all of the samples once then go through them again. The light that flashes on the sample tube increases the temperature of the liquid, so you do not want to read a sample tube twice quickly
12. All components are safe and can be disposed of in the tip waste buckets or trash
